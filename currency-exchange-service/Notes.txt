Coding Assignment (Complete and push changes ahead of the next round interview)

Create a simple Service Software for a Water filter company as a micro-service. 
With this application, an administrator should be able to add water filter installation, maintenance, or repair tickets and 
service agents will be able to view the list of tickets assigned to them and update ticket status details. 
Feel free to assume any functional requirements/attributes needed while implementing the solution. 
We expect the application to be exposed via REST endpoints. Create also a web frontend application that could be used by admins and agents after login.

Summary of Functional requirements are given below:

• Administrator should be able to create water filter installation, maintenance, or repair tickets

• Service agents should be able to view and update status details of repair tickets assigned to them.

Few non-functional requirements are

• There should be sufficient test coverage (unit / integration tests) and code quality/security checks.

• Service(s) should be observable, it should have sufficient logs and metrics

• Service(s) should be containerized and deploy-able to Kubernetes

• Automate all stages within a CI/CD pipeline

Expected Artifacts:

• Architecture diagram and sequence diagram

• Code along with unit and integration test case

• Docker File, Kubernetes manifest, Pipeline Script
